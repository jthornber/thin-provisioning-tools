NAME
  thin_delta - Print the differences in the mappings between two thin devices.

SYNOPSIS
  thin_delta [options] {device|file}

DESCRIPTION
  thin_delta allows you to compare the mappings in two thin volumes (snapshots
  allow common blocks between thin volumes).

  This tool cannot be run on live metadata unless the --metadata-snap option is
  used.

OPTIONS
  --thin1, --snap1 {natural}	The numeric identifier for the first thin volume to diff.
  --thin2, --snap2 {natural}	The numeric identifier for the second thin volume to diff.
  --metadata-snap [block nr]	Use a metadata snapshot.

    If you want to get information out of a live pool then you will need to
    take a metadata snapshot and use this switch.  In order for the information
    to be meaningful, you need to ensure the thin volumes you're examining are
    not changing (ie, do not activate those thins).

  --verbose	Provide extra information on the mappings.
  -h, --help		Print help and exit.
  -V, --version		Output version information and exit.
