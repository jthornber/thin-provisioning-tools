NAME
  era_invalidate - Provide a list of blocks that have changed since a particular era.

SYNOPSIS
  era_invalidate [options] {device|file}

DESCRIPTION
  era_invalidate examines era metadata and lists blocks that may have changed
  since a given era.

  This tool cannot be run on live metadata unless the --metadata-snap option is
  used.

OPTIONS
  -h, --help			Print help and exit.
  -V, --version			Print version information and exit.
  -o {output file}		Write output to a file rather than stdout.
  --metadata-snapshot		Use the metadata snapshot rather than the current superblock.
  --written-since {era nr}	Blocks written since the given era will be listed.

EXAMPLE
  List the blocks that may have been written since the beginning of era 13 on the
  metadata device /dev/vg/metadata:

    $ era_invalidate --written-since 13 /dev/vg/metadata

  The device may not be actively used by the target when running.

DIAGNOSTICS
  era_invalidate returns an exit code of 0 for success or 1 for error (eg,
  metadata corruption).
