NAME
  era_dump - dump era metadata from device or file to standard output.

SYNOPSIS
  era_dump [options] {device|file}

DESCRIPTION
  era_dump dumps binary era metadata created by the device-mapper era target on
  a device or file to standard output for analysis or postprocessing in
  XML format. XML formatted metadata can be fed into era_restore (see
  era_restore(8)) in order to put it back onto a metadata device (to process by
  the device-mapper target) or file.

  This tool cannot be run on live metadata.

OPTIONS
  -h, --help		Print help and exit.
  -V, --version		Print version information and exit.
  --repair		Repair the metadata whilst dumping it.
  --logical		Fold any unprocessed write sets into the final era array.

    You probably want to do this if you're intending to process the results as
    it simplifies the XML.

  -o {xml file}	Specify a file for the output rather than writing to stdout.

EXAMPLES
  Dumps era metadata on logical volume /dev/vg/metadata to standard output in
  XML format:

    $ era_dump /dev/vg/metadata

DIAGNOSTICS
  era_dump returns an exit code of 0 for success or 1 for error.
